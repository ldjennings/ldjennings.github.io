At Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am a member of a student run makerspace called Collablab. Roughly 3 years ago, the lab acquired a incomplete INTAMSYS FUNMAT Pro 3D printer, valued in excess of $30,000 which was stored inside the lab until the present day. The printer is missing vital components, such as the extruder, motors, and software. In addition, the control system uses custom, proprietary parts. The printer also takes up valuable space, much more than its lack of function deserves.

Because of all this, I decided to repair it and fix it up. To do this, I need to essentially rebuild everything except the structure of the printer. I made a funding request for new parts in the spring of 2023, but unfortunately it was denied by the student government. I haven't been able to pursue this project since then, but now that I'm back at school I am planning on getting it running by the end of the fall semester. I wont be able to get a wishlist of parts, but I will still be able to get it running well.

When I get it working, it should be the largest and most advanced printer on campus, with even the initial model having a build volume of 450 x 450 x 700 mm. The base model is also capable of printing high temperature filaments like PEEK, but I just want to get it running first.

I'm planning on eventually reworking the gantry system so that it can access more of the print area and making it a corexy system, with additional improvments after I get it working. 
This is an ongoing project, which I am still in the middle of.
