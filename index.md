I'm Liam Jennings, welcome to my portfolio site. I'm a software engineer student
from Seattle. I've graduated with my bachelors degree in Computer Science from
Worcetser Polytechnic Institute, and I'm working on my Master's in Robotics
Engineering at the same school.

I've always enjoyed problem solving, and software engineering was a natural
extension to that. After trying it, I started learning robotics so I could solve
physical problems. Since then, I've delved into robotic controls and machine
learning through classes at my college. I also dabble a bit with cyber security.

I love to read in my spare time, and hike with friends. Cooking is fun too!

I'm currently working at a co-op at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) for
the fall of 2025. I'm a Hardware Test Engineer for some of their newest
products.

My primary goal is to build cool robots with the intelligence and dexterity
required to solve real world problems. I'd really like it if these robots were
in space.
