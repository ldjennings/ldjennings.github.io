If you're here for the Machine Learning Project my group did for CS539 at WPI, click [here](https://ldjennings.github.io/CS539FinalProject). My group used this url before I decided to make it into my website. I'll get around to updating Professor Kyumin Lee at some point. 

<!-- I'm Liam Jennings, welcome to my portfolio site. I'm a guy who knows some stuff about computer science and robotics, and likes use that knowy stuff to make cool things. Please pay me to do this.



I'm a software engineer from Seattle. I've always enjoyed problem solving, and software engineering was a natural extension to that. After trying it, I started learning robotics so I could solve physical problems. Since then, I've delved into robotic controls and machine learning through classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I also dabble a bit with cyber security.

I love to read in my spare time, and hate myself while hiking. Cooking is fun too!

I recently interned at STR, where I worked on a cyber security project involving .NET programs. 

My primary goal is to build cool robots with the intelligence required to solve real world problems.  -->
